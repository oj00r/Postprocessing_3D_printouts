<h1>Postprocessing 3D Titanium Printouts</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
My bachelor’s thesis, done at TUL, investigated chemical etching (CE) as a post-processing method for 3D-printed titanium parts produced via SLM. 

This method not only allows for the creation of adjustable shapes for bone implants but also enables the modification of porosity and internal structure to better mimic the properties of host tissue. However, during manufacturing, loose particles can adhere to the material’s surface, making the implant potentially hazardous for a patient. Luckly, this risk can be minimized by etching the object in strong acid, which was the my main objective.

<h2>Materials</h2>

- <b>10x10x10mm Porous cubic samples - printed with titanium alloy</b>
- <b>Hydrofluoric Acid of X%, Y% and Z%</b>
- <b>Isopropanol</b>

<h2>Equipment used</h2>

- <b>Beakers</b>
- <b>Digital Microscope</b> 
- <b>Ultrasound cleaner</b> 
- <b>Moisture balance</b> 
- <b>Servohydraulic Axial - Torsional Test System</b>

After post-processing, the samples were analyzed under a digital microscope. Surface evaluation was used to determine the optimal concentration and processing time. The first photo of Fig 1. clearly shows under-etched material, while the last photo shows over-etched one.

Samples’ weights were analyzed before and after etching (- look Fig 2.), as well as their compression strength. Figure 3 shows an exemplary results of compression test, highlighting the region of plastic deformation, which is unwated in human implants.

Finally, the etching depth of the best-performing samples was evaluated. They were sawed in half and distance from the surface to the first particles occuring. In general, the differences were noticable.

<h2>Summary</h2>

Doing the thesis on 3D printing introduced me to problems that can occur at every step of manufacturing a product, no matter if it is very popular or niche. In this project, I was able to determine near-optimal conditions, though challenges like particles trapped inside the porous structure remain.

I also gained insight into the wide variety of tests and material properties available with current state-of-the-art technology. Overall, I am very glad to have experienced engineering problem worked under a cooperation with scietits at my univeristy, which can only my perspecitve in solving real-world problems :).
